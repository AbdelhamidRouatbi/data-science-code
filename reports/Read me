NHL Data Project 

Overview 

This project downloads, processes, and visualizes NHL play-by-play data for seasons 2016–2023. It produces clean datasets and an interactive tool to explore games and events. 

Step-by-Step Process 

Step 1: Data Acquisition 

Purpose: Download raw NHL game data from the API. 
What it does: 

Connects to NHL API endpoints 

Downloads play-by-play data for seasons 2016–2023 

Saves raw JSON files for each game 

Files created: 

data/raw/season_XXXX/general/ 

data/raw/season_XXXX/playoff/ 

Run: 

python download_all_data.py 

Forme 

Step 2: Data Processing 

Purpose: Convert raw JSON files into structured data. 
What it does: 

Parses JSON game files 

Extracts shots and goals events 

Creates clean CSV files for each game 

Adds player names and team information 

Files created: 

data/processed/season_XXXX/general/ 

data/processed/season_XXXX/playoff/ 

Run: 

python data_processor.py 

Forme 

Step 3: Tidy Data Creation 

Purpose: Combine all games into analysis-ready datasets. 
What it does: 

Combines all individual game files 

Creates unified plays.csv and players.csv 

Calculates additional features (distance, shot angles) 

Cleans missing values 

Files created: 

data/tidy/plays.csv 

data/tidy/players.csv 

Run: 

python tidy_data_creator.py 

Forme 

Step 4: Data Wrangling 

Purpose: Final data preparation and basic analysis. 
What it does: 

Creates summary statistics 

Generates basic visualizations 

Prepares data for interactive tool 

Files created: 

data/tidy/all_seasons_combined.csv 

Run: 

python data_wrangling.py 

Forme 

Step 5: Interactive Visualization 

Purpose: Explore data with interactive widgets. 
What it does: 

Creates dropdown menus for seasons and games 

Shows individual events on NHL rink 

Displays shot maps for entire games 

Provides detailed event information 

Run in Jupyter Notebook: 

from interactive_tool import launch_interactive_tool 

launch_interactive_tool() 

Forme
