Q2.1: Interactive Debugging Tool

Implementation Overview:
I built an interactive tool to help navigate and visualize NHL play-by-play data. The interface includes dropdown menus to select seasons (2016-2023), game types (regular season or playoffs), and specific games. A slider lets users scroll through each event in the chosen game.

The display is divided into three sections:

An ice rink diagram showing event locations

A complete event list for the selected game

Detailed information about the currently selected event

Key Features:

Dropdown selectors for season, game type, and game ID

Event navigation slider

Rink visualization with color-coded events (blue for shots, red stars for goals)

Real-time event details including coordinates, distance calculations, and player information

Purpose:
This tool serves as a debugging aid to verify data processing accuracy. It helps validate that coordinate mapping, distance calculations, and shot direction assignments are working correctly. The visual representation makes it easy to cross-reference with official NHL data.

Current Limitation:
A significant challenge in calculating precise shot distances is that the NHL data provides shot coordinates but not shooting direction. This creates ambiguity for shots taken near center ice or from defensive zones where it's unclear which net the player was targeting.

To address this, I implemented a team-period approach that analyzes where most of a team's shots originate during a period to infer which net they're attacking. While this method works reasonably well in most cases, it remains an estimation rather than a perfect solution.

Q4.1: Dataframe Example + Strength Analysis

Sample Data Structure:

game_id	season	game_type	event_type	period	x_coord	y_coord	shot_type	team_name	player_name	distance_from_net	is_goal
2016020001	2016	general	SHOT_ON_GOAL	1	-77	5	wrist	Toronto Maple Leafs	Player_8478483	13.0	0
2016020001	2016	general	SHOT_ON_GOAL	1	86	13	wrist	Ottawa Senators	Player_8467967	13.34	0
2016020001	2016	general	GOAL	1	-20	15	slap	Toronto Maple Leafs	Player_8471239	69.0	1
Enhancing Strength Information:
To add detailed strength situations (like 5v4, 5v3, etc.) for both shots and goals, we could:

Monitor penalty events - Track when penalties begin and end to determine power play/penalty kill situations

Analyze shift data - Count active players on ice for each team at any given moment

Combine game context - Use penalty and faceoff information to reconstruct the exact player count scenario

This enhancement would require incorporating additional event types beyond just shots and goals, particularly penalties, faceoffs, and potentially player shift information if available.

Q4.2: Three Potential Feature Enhancements

1. Rebound Detection

Approach: Identify shots that occur shortly after previous shot attempts by the same team

Method: Calculate time elapsed between consecutive shots (e.g., under 3 seconds) and flag rapid sequences as potential rebounds

Benefit: Helps recognize high-danger scoring opportunities that develop from immediate follow-up attempts

2. Rush Chance Identification

Approach: Detect shots that happen quickly after entering the offensive zone

Method: Flag shots occurring within a short timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds) of zone entry events

Benefit: Distinguishes between transition opportunities and set offensive plays, providing insight into team speed and counter-attack effectiveness

3. Shot Quality Assessment

Approach: Create a composite metric that evaluates shot danger using multiple factors

Method: Combine distance from net, shooting angle, shot type, and game situation to estimate scoring probability

Benefit: Offers a more nuanced understanding of shot quality beyond basic location data, helping identify which shots are truly dangerous
